**Responsive Fullscreen Color Transition Interface by Andr oDei**

This interactive web project presents a fullscreen, responsive color interface that alternates automatically every second between two visual modes:

1. **Striped Mode**: Six horizontal color stripes—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet—are displayed in a randomly shuffled vertical order across the screen. Each stripe fills an equal portion of the screen height.

2. **Grid Mode**: The view transforms into a 6×6 grid of square tiles. Each tile is randomly assigned one of the six base colors. The height of each tile precisely matches the height of the stripes from the previous mode, maintaining visual consistency.

Every second, the display automatically switches between the stripe and grid modes, continuously reshuffling the colors to create a dynamic, ever-changing composition.

This project demonstrates responsive layout techniques, basic DOM manipulation, and randomized color arrangements using JavaScript and CSS, suitable for creative coding experiments, interactive installations, or visual art prototypes.
